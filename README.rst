The Budget Battle
=================
On June 15th, the `Texas Tribune`_ launched `this`_ timeline showing our
coverage of the budget battle.

There's a few pieces of JavaScript that are interesting that might be of use
to other developers working on interactive infographics.  Namely:

* Sticky navigation elements
* Fading elements out

Nothing ground breaking here---it was thrown together quickly, but I thought it
might be useful as examples.
